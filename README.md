# J-TAX PAYER

## Project Overview
**J-TAX PAYER** is an intelligent and inclusive taxpayer management system designed for Jigawa State, Nigeria. This modern, government-scale application replaces the existing Jigawa State Internal Revenue Service (JIRS) tax software, aiming to revolutionize tax administration through automation, transparency, and data-driven decision-making.

## Project Description
J-TAX PAYER is a comprehensive tax management solution built with inclusivity at its core. The system addresses real-world challenges such as literacy barriers and limited digital access by supporting two primary user pathways:

- **Literate taxpayers** can interact directly with the system
- **Illiterate taxpayers** are assisted by government-authorized agents



The system is implemented using a modern web architecture with a React frontend, a Python Flask RESTful backend, and a PostgreSQL database. Although developed as an academic monolithic prototype, the architecture is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and ready for future deployment in a real government environment.

## System Actors

**1. Taxpayer (Literate User)**
Interacts directly with the application to register, manage businesses, and pay taxes.

**2. Agent (Government-Authorized)**
Assists illiterate taxpayers by performing registration and payment operations on their behalf.

**3. Admin (JIRS Officials)**
Manages users, agents, tax configurations, and system analytics.

**4. Analytics Dashboard**
Provides administrative insights derived from system data.
